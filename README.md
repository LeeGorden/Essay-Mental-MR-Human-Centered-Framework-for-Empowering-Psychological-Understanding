<summary>Introduction</summary>
  
As applications of ML algorithms in real life become increasingly common, ethical issues of AI solutions emerge especially in a sensitive human-related field such as the medical care industry. The output of the responsible AI framework proposed are images demonstrated to be in both high accuracy and high interpretability in field experiments with accuracy higher than 90% by prediction based on bare human eyes. More importantly, the images generated under the responsible framework enable experts in the field of mental health to diagnose mental disorders even if they do not know ML algorithms.
  
**In this branch, VAE + t-SNE is used to see if the pattern of the images are explicitly identified and thus proving the quality of the images made.**

<summary>Result</summary>

- Images are represented in a latent space based on VAE. After getting the high-dimension latent expression of an image, Gaussian Mixture Model is used to identify clusters. Meanwhile, t-SNE is applied to Î¼ in latent expression to visualize images pattern on a 2D plane.
  
  Latent-expressing images after applying t-SNE:

  Latent-expressing images after applying t-SNE, meanwhile using GMM to find out clusters according to latent expression, red = positive case, blue = negative case. We can see there is a clear difference between positive and negative samples:

  Pattern Tree is as follows, in different location of 2D plane, there appear to be different in place showing darker pixels:

  Here's an example of positive image and negative:
