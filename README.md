<summary>Introduction</summary>
  
As applications of ML algorithms in real life become increasingly common, ethical issues of AI solutions emerge especially in a sensitive human-related field such as the medical care industry. The output of the responsible AI framework proposed are images demonstrated to be in both high accuracy and high interpretability in field experiments with accuracy higher than 90% by prediction based on bare human eyes. More importantly, the images generated under the responsible framework enable experts in the field of mental health to diagnose mental disorders even if they do not know ML algorithms.
  
**In this branch, we fucus on how to use Network Science to visualize tabular data.**
