<summary>Introduction</summary>
  
As the applications of ML algorithms in real life become increasingly common, ethical issues of AI solutions emerge especially in a sensitive human-related field such as the medical care industry. The output of the responsible AI framework proposed are images demonstrated to be in both high accuracy and high interpretability in field experiments with accuracy higher than 90% by prediction based on bare human eyes. More importantly, the images generated under the responsible framework enable experts in the field of mental health to diagnose mental disorders even if they do not know ML algorithms.

- Image created under the framework:
  
  Based on responsible AI using CNN model trained, interpretation of pixels towards each mental disorder is as follows:

  Combining responsible AI, final images are as follows:

  Each image represents a patient, and it is split into different areas. Those areas express different mental disorders. **The darker the pixels are within certain area, the higher the possibility that the patient will have corresponding mental disorder.**
